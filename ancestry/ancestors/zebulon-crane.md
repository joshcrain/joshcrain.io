<p>ZEBULON CRANE was born February 21, 1753. He married Rhoda Thompson on November 27, 1777, who was also of Alstead, New Hampshire by a Justice of the Peace. Rhoda&rsquo;s maiden name, Thompson, suggests a English or Scottish origin. Pension documents state they had 5 children: Thedosia, Ebenezer, Eunice, Elijah and Nabby. One child, Tryphena, died at two years of age (E.B. Crane).</p>
<p>Zebulon served twice in the Revolutionary War. He later received financial help through the Revolutionary War Pension Act of 1818. Zebulon first enlisted in November or December of 1775. He served in the New Hampshire line in Captain Jason Waits' Company, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedel’s_Regiment">Colonel Bedel&rsquo;s Regiment</a>.</p>
<p>In February 1776 Bedel’s Regiment traveled to Quebec and by April occupied a strategic position at The Cedars. On May 18 he fought in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_The_Cedars">Battle of The Cedars</a> where he killed an Iroqois who had injured him with a tomahawk. A day later on May 19th, the British captured his regiment. The commander of his garrison, Brigadier General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benedict_Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a>, negotiated a release. On May 30th the British released his regiment at Fort Anne. On January 1, 1777 Bedel&rsquo;s Regiment disbanded when enlistments expired. Zebulon was discharged on that date at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Independence_(Vermont)">Mount Independence</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatio_Gates">General Horatio Gates</a>.</p>
  <p>Zebulon enlisted again, this time as a private in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellow's_Regiment_of_Militia">Colonel Benjamin Bellow&rsquo;s battalion</a>, Captain William Cary&rsquo;s Company. They served in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whipple">General William Whipple’s</a> brigade of the New Hampshire militia. He served at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a> in the spring of 1777.</p>
<p>The Continental Army needed reinforcements for the Saratoga Campaign. On September 21, 1777, Bellow&rsquo;s Regiment of Militia was called up at Walpole, New Hampshire. The regiment marched to join the forces of General Gates who faced British General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a> in northern New York.</p>

  <p>Bellow’s battalion was part of the New Hampshire militia brigade commanded by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Whipple">General William Whipple</a>, and although they did not serve in the Battles of Saratoga, were present at the siege of Saratoga which forced  the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saratoga_campaign#Surrender">surrender of General Burgoyne</a> (Eric Schnitzer, NPS). In Zebulon’s 1818 pension testimony he claims to have been present at the &ldquo;at the capture of General Burgoyne.&quot;Brigadier general Whipple is depicted in  John Trumbull’s painting, <em>The Surrender of General Burgoyne</em>, fifth from the right. With the surrender of Burgoyne’s Army on October 17 the regiment was disbanded on October 27, 1777.</p>
  <p>On April 21, 1818, at the time of his pension testimony, he lived in Brookfield, Vermont. E.B. Crane places him  in Williamstown, Vermont &ldquo;for a time.&rdquo; The <em>Census of Pensioners for Revolutionary Or Military Service</em> performed on June 1, 1840; places Zebulon, age 79, in Clarendon, Vermont with an Orin Hewitt, the head of that household. The Vermont Historical Society claims his grave is located in Clarendon, but it is still unclear which cemetery. Zebulon&rsquo;s date of death was September 9, 1828. Rhoda died on November 3, 1839 according to her son Elijah’s pension testimony on August 25, 1847 .</p>

<p>Zebulon purchases land near Surry, New Hampshire around 1790.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Job Thomson, one of the proprietors of the &ldquo;John Slade Cemetery,&rdquo; bought 81 acres of land of John Slade in 1779, extending from the Surry road to Walpole line. He was living on this farm as late as March, 1790, when he sold 26 acres from the west end to Zebulon Crane, son of Lemuel Crane. In 1795 this land was described in a deed as &ldquo;William Thomson’s land&rdquo; and is the same farm that Capt. William Thomson owned and lived on at his death in 1833. The house, in which Capt. Thomson lived, was very likely built by Job Thomson, who is believed to have been William’s father.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Zebulon Crane sold land to Thomas Root on March, 29, 1782 (Peck, p. 41)</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Thomas Root signed the remonstrance against setting off a parish in Alstead, May 31, 1793. July 30, 1795, he sold his farm of thirty-two acres on the east side of the Surry road, consisting of twelve acres from Lot 2 in the first range and twenty acres from Lot 2 in the second range which he bought of Zebulon Crane, March 29, 1782, to his brother-in- law, William Slade, and probably removed from town.
