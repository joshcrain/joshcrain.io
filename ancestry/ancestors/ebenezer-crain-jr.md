    <blockquote>
      <p>The Crain Family is one of our community’s leading families in 1956. We are indebted to Albert W. Crain for the sketch of the pioneer family.</p>
      <p>Ebenezer Crain was born July, 1819. His wife, Calista, was born March, 1823. We are not certain if we have Calista’s maiden name spelled correctly. The name we have is Cobern. It is possible the name was Cobert or Colbert.</p>
      <p>We know that Ebenezer and Calista lived in New Hampshire after their marriage. They moved to our community in 1876 from Wisconsin. Their first home in our community was located near the Sunset post office. Later they lived in the Grant Center community of Hardin County.</p>
      <p>We know that three of their children came to our community in 1876. They were Arthur L., Alice and Albert. A daughter, Julia, came with her husband, John Adams. </p>
      <p>Ebenezer died on February 1, 1905. Calista died on October 16, 1900. They are buried in the Illinois Grove Cemetery.</p>
