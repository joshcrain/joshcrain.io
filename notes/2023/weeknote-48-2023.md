I read a helpful article about [web components by Nolan Lawson](https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/). Nolan discusses many of the same pros and cons I’ve wrestled with over the last year and a half. It was nice to have stumbled upon his thoughts and to be able to validate some of my thinking and suspicions—especially as it relates to enterprise. 

How web projects get built can be contentious, people like to stick with what they know and enjoy. There are big opinions out there. In most cases, I think “the how” is not that important—use what works! As much as we would like to think so, clients don‘t care about _the how_. 

In my case, the how (tooling, etc.) was also a design and architecture problem. I tried for years to reign in the front-end madness but made little ground. Web components solved a lot of problems—more problems than they created and provided a path to safely build at scale across platforms. One of the greatest benefits is the ability to iterate, to make a component better over time (or fix bugs) without having to coordinate across, in some cases, many implementations and teams. Work gets done faster, more value is created, etc. 

There are certainly downsides (and a learning curve) but at the end of the day, it‘s the web platform and it’s here to stay. That‘s pretty compelling, especially if you are someone who has spent any time updating and then testing front-end libraries.
