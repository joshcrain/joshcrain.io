* I posted a [webcomic](/notes/2020/itll-all-be-over-by-christmas/) last week and used it as an opportunity to learn about [11ty Image](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/). I'm excited to use it to manage image resizing and RWD markup. I have [quite a few images](https://vsco.co/joshcrain/) I’d like to post (and host) since this site is all about taking back control of my corner of the web. The only way to truly do that is to automate. 
* Placed luminaries near the road for us and the neighbors on New Year’s Eve.
