* The previous week was very cold with lows around 2 above. When I woke up Tuesday morning the temperature was -17 degrees. 
* This week's Beyond the Easel with Christine Lashley and Scott Christensen was really helpful. Artist [David Dibble](https://www.dibbleart.com) shared tricks to extract value information while on location, in art, and photos. David provided helpful tips on using Photoshop and provided examples of how improve value in composition.
* Trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note taking *and* managing Markdown files used in this site. Pretty cool. The really cool thing about Obsidian is it's just a shell application that manages Markdown files stored locally or a cloud storage of choice. Since the files exist (and are still meaningful) outside of Obsidian, there is a great amount of flexibility. Changes saved in a Markdown file are automatically saved, processed with Eleventy, and an HTML file is output with the changes.
