date: 2021-05-21

- I woke up early Sunday morning with vertigo and a cold or allergies. It's been an uncomfortable week. 
- Saturday I decided to go to the doctor. Double ear infection in addition to the vertigo. 
- Bitbucket Pipeline's automation to includes publishing production-ready CSS to S3 only [if certain files are changed](https://dev.to/omar16100/trigger-bitbucket-pipeline-only-if-certain-files-are-changed-with-google-cloud-functions-1abc), then I send a corresponding notification, using [Slack Notify](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/slack-notify/src/master/), to my project's Slack channel.
