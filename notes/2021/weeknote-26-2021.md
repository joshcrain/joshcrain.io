description: OS upgrade, Safari 15, tinkerings. Nothing else.
date: 2021-06-25

- Updated my OS from Catalina 10.15.7 to Big Sur 11.4. I must have deferred the upgrade, but for the life of me I can't remember.
- Experimented with Safari TP and the theme-color meta tag after watching a video about [Design for Safari 15](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10029/). This tinkering makes me want to update the hero with something more _flashy_.
