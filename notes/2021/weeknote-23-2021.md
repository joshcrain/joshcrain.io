- Memorial Day weekend went quickly. 
- Early in the week I am still feeling the affects of the prednisone. I've searched for what would be a good way to describe how I feel and the only thing I can think of is it feels like I have a bad sunburn. Not that my skin feels any different but my body feels tired, stressed, and my heart rate has been elevated. By Monday I've started to sleep most of the night—and sleep very soundly. 
- Smoked a brisket on Sunday. It was a little spicy with the store-bought rub, but good. 
- I've decided to give Pocket a try. Instead of endlessly opening new tabs on my phone every time I find an article, Pocket will hold on to this stuff and sync it to my desktop for later review. I've been resistant to different apps for bookmarking and reading, because in the past it seems I spend more time _hunting_ for articles rather than reading. Perhaps this will be different and a better way to hang on to the stuff that I need to read over the course of a few days. 
- A redesigned Firefox 89 was released. It's really nice.
