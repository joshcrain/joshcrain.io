- A few weeks ago I added a few small animations to this site. It occurred to me, after reading about [taking a no-motion-first approach to animations](https://tatianamac.com/posts/prefers-reduced-motion/) I had forgotten this very basic step towards accessibility. I updated the site again this week to utilize this approach. 
- Though there is a new movie coming out the original [Space Jam](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/) website is still up at an updated URL. When web designers talk about the early days of web design this is often the site pointed to as an example. It’s really interesting to see how far we've come (or not) with performance. I ran a Lighthouse test on each for performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO. The 2021 site scored 90, 93, 87, and 90. The 1996 site scored 100, 85, 87, 80. 
- I continue to play around with an [HSLA color system](https://codepen.io/joshcrain/pen/zYoXjaN) on CodePen using CSS variables. I'm not sure why it’s taking me so long to discover the HSLA syntax, it makes a lot of sense. BUT...
- Then I learned a little about [LCH Colors](https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/) and I want this now.
