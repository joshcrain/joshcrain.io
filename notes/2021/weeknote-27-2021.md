- Ordered a cover for the chuckbox I made. Even though we aren't camping right now, Iâ€™ve been using the chuckbox for an outdoor kitchen when smoking meat. A few weeks ago I built a dolly to help move it around. 
- Found out how to use [Emmet For Nunjuck Files on VSCode](https://www.michael1e.com/turning-on-emmet-for-nunjuck-files-on-vscode/).
