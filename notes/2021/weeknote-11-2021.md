- [System fonts donâ€™t have to be ugly](https://iainbean.com/posts/2021/system-fonts-dont-have-to-be-ugly/). This is something I keep coming back to. The article made me consider _again_ the use of _only_ webfonts. This article has me thinking about it again, especially after a closer look at _Charter_.
- Updated the site to use Georgia instead of [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) which removes two HTTP requests. I'll be interested to see if this improves my rank on [Speedlify](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/#site-953e66da).
- Ran 3 miles on Monday. 6:55, 6:41, 6:51 for 20:26. 
- [This Web Site is a Tech Talk](https://www.zachleat.com/web/this-website-is-a-tech-talk/) was a lot of fun. 
- More people we know are being vaccinated. The progress there seems to be moving more quickly. The federal government has instructed or advised states to have COVID vaccines available for adults by the end of June. At one point there was a timeline of late summer or fall.
