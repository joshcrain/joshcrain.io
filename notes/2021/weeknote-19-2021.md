description: BBQ again, Bitbucket Pipeline, Web Component. 
date: 2021-05-03

- Smoked ribs and two Boston Butts last weekend with the WSM. It was fun to learn to do something new and have BBQ again. This last year has been mostly "restaurant free." 
- Built a Bitbucket Pipeline to automatically deploy an Eleventy site using Fractal assets. Maxime Heckel provided good background to [build a serverless preview deployment](https://blog.maximeheckel.com/posts/build-serverless-preview-deployment). Then I followed the steps to setup [continuous deployment of AWS S3 static site](https://initialcommit.com/blog/continuous-deployment-aws-s3).
- Created an example Web Component from last weekâ€™s learning that adds a [browser frame for screenshots](https://codepen.io/joshcrain/pen/EPNaBY). I'm still troubleshooting some style issues.
