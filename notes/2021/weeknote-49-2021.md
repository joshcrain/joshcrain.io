- Nearing another new year... I realized the copyright date in the footer of this site was static text so I updated the template to use a [Moment](https://momentjs.com/) filter to output the current year. 
- Read an [old-ish article](https://24ways.org/2018/managing-flow-and-rhythm-with-css-custom-properties/) from Andy Bell and learned some helpful things about [Lobotomized Owls in CSS](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/). Recently, I've thought a bit about about my approach to CSS resets after seeing [Josh Comeau's CSS Reset](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/). It's been so long since I've reviewed what I use. Andy's approach isn't exactly a reset, but the modern, concise approach avoids the [otherwise inevitable bloat](https://css-tricks.com/spacing-the-bottom-of-modules/) and gets a lot done.
