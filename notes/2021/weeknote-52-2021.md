description: A technology statement gets me thinking, a self portrait.

- This week I encountered a [technology statement](https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/blob/main/TECHNOLOGY.md) from The [A11Y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/). What a good idea. I’ve been thinking a lot about design principles and how they define what should be valued and what should be avoided. Technology decisions are often made out of convenience or comfort. Decisions around tech stacks do not always support the user or encourage a wider community of contributors. 
- I finished a self portrait. I felt OK about the construction of the head but somewhat disappointed with the line quality. It's been five years since I've attempted any sort of self-portrait. What I realized is that I have been so busy chasing after certain subjects that I’ve missed the subjects that are right in front of me.
