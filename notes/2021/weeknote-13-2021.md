- Added this site to [personalsit.es](https://personalsit.es/).
- Added a few animations to the site to spice things up a bit. I tested on Speedlify to make sure there weren't any performance impacts, but I see a lower score. Still have 100’s across the board from Lighthouse, but I will test again to see if it’s an anomoly. 
- Did a little reading on the performance costs of animations. Animations that use position or opacity are cheap, so I'm surprised the site took a hit. 
- Learned [a thing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/animations/animations-and-performance) about the `will-change` property.
