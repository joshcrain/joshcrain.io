Each new year is an opportunity to look back over the last year and look forward to the next. I felt compelled to drop a few notes here, mostly for my own clarity. Most years December arrives and I struggle to recollect the last few months—let alone the year. 

In the last year I’ve noticed a transition to a more sustainable cadence of work and life. Often, I _still_ find myself running about the house to finish one more thing but gone are the 4:30 am starts and missed lunches. [The horizon _still_ seems a bit gloomy](/notes/2020/itll-all-be-over-by-christmas/) even after another year but I am incredibly grateful for the people who, during this crazy time in history, have come into my life. 

## Art
Progress, as it has for a number of years, has been disappointing. It seems though, I have set myself up for failure. I have wanted to paint. I have had an ideal that I’ve measured against which has created an obstacle more than a goal. Painting requires time, preparation, materials, and space. I have not had any of these things in any great quantity and so I find myself stuck, never able to execute. The basic and most essential thing I must do is draw, so I'll do that.

## This site
Site speed has been a priority for this site in 2021. I was [the fastest](/notes/2021/the-fastest/) on the [Eleventy Speedlify Leaderboard](https://www.11ty.dev/speedlify/#site-953e66da) for No. [15](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1424715642884739074) and [16](https://twitter.com/eleven_ty/status/1448348220787249152). Admittedly, the optimizations were often designed for the algorithm ranking over site speed but this was why it was fun. 

I didn't write much again this year. This is the 5th post of 2021. 

### Garmin Plugin
I created an Eleventy plugin to create a [running log with Garmin Connect](/notes/2021/eleventy-garmin-connect/) data. I use it on this site to capture and log running activities over time. The site build process triggers automatically with a Zapier action after every run, so there's nothing needed to update the [running log](/about/running/)—I love it. 

## What I Learned
- I spent time learning about [Web Components](/notes/2021/weeknote-18-2021/).
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](/notes/2021/weeknote-19-2021/) and [YAML anchors](/notes/2021/weeknote-20-2021/).
- [Whitespace is tricky](/notes/2021/whitespace-regex-vscode/)
- CSS has had a good year. There is (once again) _a lot_ to learn. 

## Job Notes
I work on a team where I help design and build a web application. In 2020 I began to use a static site generator to build an interactive prototype but was limited to a single site. With so many features in flight in 2021 I needed a way to scale. I built a Bitbucket Pipeline to launch a Docker container, install and run Node commands, build and continuously deploy UI components and interactive prototypes by branch to a CDN, and notify the team in Slack. The automation allows me to quickly explore design solutions and deliver an interactive prototype specific to each feature to others on the product team. 

I work remotely from home. It has been good. I retired the desk I bought from Staples in 2002 after I moved my home office for the 3rd or 4th time. 

## Running 
Working from home has made it possible to be more consistent with [running in 2021](/about/running/2021/), especially since the fall. I added a weekly 10K in October and continue to feel great. 

I averaged 6.4 miles per week for the year. 18.2 miles per week for the month of December, which is when all my best times for the year occurred: 
- 1K: 3:41 on [12/23/2021](/about/running/2021/#8000744577)
- 1 mile: 5:53 on [12/23/2021](/about/running/2021/#8000744577)
- 5K: 19:51 on [12/23/2021](/about/running/2021/#8000744577)
- 10K: 40:10 on [12/19/2021](/about/running/2021/#7983345732)

No races this year, maybe in 2022.
