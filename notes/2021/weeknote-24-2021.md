description: First run since vertigo and it was hot. Garmin Connect data, and date and time inputs.

- I went for a run a little before noon on Monday. It was my first run back since experiencing vertigo a few weeks ago. I averaged 6:48 per mile. The first half felt almost too good to be true, and I guess it was. The last half was pretty uncomfortable with the heat. It must have been 20 degrees warmer than when I last ran. 
- Pulled together a few ideas to bring Garmin Connect JSON data into a website using Eleventy and [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch).
- Safari added support for `<input type="date">` and `<input type="time">` in Safari 14.1 making it a viable input solution (as long as thereâ€™s no need to support IE).
