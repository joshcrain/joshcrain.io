- Learned about `fit-content` to help [fit content](https://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/vYmzZyo?editors=1100) into an absolutely positioned container. 
- [Had a good run](/running/2021/7246176796/). 19:50 for 3 miles or 6:36/mi.
- Added IDs to each row of my [Running Log](/running/) to jump to a particular activity using a URI fragment. 
- Signed up for the 2022 Grand Blue Mile. $10.00 Olympics sale. I hope I don't forget. 
- Oh my... what is this? [Kid Pix](https://kidpix.app/) was released in the public domain and rebuilt in HTML and JS. One of my childhood favorites for sure.
