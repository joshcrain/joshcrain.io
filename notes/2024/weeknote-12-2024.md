- I spent some time adjusting the code of the site to try to make it a little more concise and readable. Removed unneeded CSS utilities and replaced them, where applicable, with refactored code. Once such example is the site header where I was able to reduce some HTML. 
- Also, fixed an animated gif that didn't work with Eleventy image. Gifs will be pass through files now.
