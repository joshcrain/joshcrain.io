It's that time of year again. It's time to look back at the previous year to think about what's been done and what I might do differently. 
## This site
I've been thinking about how much I like my website this year. I've never been able to dedicate a lot of time to it in one sitting but over time it has shaped up. In past years, I've spent a lot more time on the mechanics of things—how some thing should work. But this year I spent a little more time rounding out the design. I made some general [design updates](/notes/2024/design-updates/) to smooth out some rough edges, and added a page for [tags](/tags/) and updated [notes](/notes/). I'm particularly happy with the notes page because it pulls together different types of notes in one place. The page includes blog posts, of course, but also notes added to my running activities, and weeknotes.

The focus though has been less on how I want things to work more on how I want to present the site. Perhaps for that reason, the site fell from 42nd to 92nd on the Eleventy Leaderboards (out of 957). But come on—it's still pretty fast. The last update to the leaderboard run was in March. 

Generative artificial intelligence has been a very big topic this year. I _have_ found it useful in troubleshooting code and finding quick answers, much like I would use StackOverflow. ChatGPT can often get me straight to an answer, and that is helpful. But there's something ugly about how generative AI harvests other people's work and cheapens the human voice. The Github repo for this site is open for anyone (or anything) to look at, but this year, I decided to [block AI](https://github.com/joshcrain/joshcrain.io/blob/master/ai.txt) from crawling this site.

## Professional
In 2023 much of my work was to support the unification of two web-based platforms. The design system I created using web components was a big help to facilitate this work. However, in 2024 the teams learned (through client feedback) that the work of bringing together these two products was not solely a technical problem. This was no surprise to me—but now with some direct feedback, everyone feels a bit more aligned with the work. In the last months of 2024, I worked on more prototypes and participated in more client interviews than I have in a while. This renewed focus on the user will keep me busy, especially in the first part of 2025.

## Art
I participated in the [Strata Easel Challenge](/art/strada-easel-challenge/) where I drew or painted each day during January. This was a good start to the year and I could feel the benefit of "a lot of starts." Unfortunately, this did not continue and it's probably my greatest regret of the year.

In the last week of the year I did some small gouache studies in a sketchbook. The studies are of work by Edgar Payne. I hope to continue, I think this kind of practice will help me with composition and speed up my color mixing.

## Socials
I closed my Instagram and Twitter accounts this year. One of the main reasons I started this site was to combat my tendency to frequent these platforms. I never felt like it was time well spent and I never really built anything. We have no control over what happens there but we do on our  website. The algorithms have become increasingly an advantage to others who post all the time. X (formally known as Twitter) was very helpful over the years as a way to be exposed to conversations around front-end development and the browser. But lately so much other negativity—it's hardly worth it. Both sites began scraping content to feed their generative A.I. models. This, honestly, was what did it for me.

## Books Read
I read some books this year but I also started listening to audiobooks.
- Born to Run by Christopher McDougall. This is a book I've wanted to read for years. In high school and college, we were always looking for books like this that let us glimpse into the world of super-human runners. Later, I found [recipes for Tarahumara Pinole and Chia](https://www.nomeatathlete.com/tarahumara-pinole-chia-recipes/).
- The Stranger in the Woods by Michael Finkel. The story of Christopher Knight, the North Pond Hermit, who in 1986 walked into the Maine woods and disappeared for 27 years.
- Hunt, Gather, Parent by Michaeleen Doucleff. How the oldest cultures in the world have mastered the art of raising well-adjusted kids and how different that process looks compared to modern Western culture. 

## Wrapping up
I thought very seriously about not writing a 2024 wrap-up. I've done it for a few years now, but I've never enjoyed doing it. It feels like a chore and most of what I write about feels like a bunch of statistics. And after all that I put on this website isn't my whole life. Even so, after it's done, I do find it helpful to see what was happening each year.
