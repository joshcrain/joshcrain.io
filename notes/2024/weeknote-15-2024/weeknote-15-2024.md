The energy produced by my solar array dipped significantly during the 2024 North American Solar Eclipse. The eclipse began at 12:43 PM  and ended at 3:13 PM local time with totality (75-80%) occurring at 1:58 PM. Lowest production was between 2:00 to 2:15 pm. Leading up to the eclipse the array produced 1.3 kWh but then during totality dipped to .3 kWh.
