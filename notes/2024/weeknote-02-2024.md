- The first major snowfall of the season. Received about nine or ten inches by January 9th. Another snow, this time a blizzard, with another 8 to 10. 20 inches in 3 days. 
- Completed the first week of Strada Easel Challenge. I’ve already learned a lot about my own patterns of working. I am so rusty, so weak. After the first few days the pace didn’t feel sustainable. I do see very plainly now how necessary discomfort is for growth. Without it I get no where new. So if anything, that's my encouragement.
