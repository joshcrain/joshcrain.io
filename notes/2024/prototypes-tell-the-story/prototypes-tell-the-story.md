description: Prototypes help to tell the story of what we are building and why.

Prototypes serve a variety of purposes in my work. They help me learn something new or communicate an idea. When I use them to communicate they can illustrate a nuanced idea or something larger. That _something larger_ can be a difficult thing to convey because, as with any project of scale, it’s probably wide-ranging, complicated, and there are a variety of stakeholders to consider. Even the basic story that answers the questions of, “Where are we and where do we go from here?” need to be addressed with some regularity. When I reflect on how prototypes help me tell this story I think of a scene from _Back to the Future_. In this scene, Doc Brown presents his plan to return Marty to 1985. A replica of Hill Valley’s courthouse square using everyday objects is spread out on a table in Doc’s shop.

> **Doc**: “Let me show you my plan for sending you home. Please excuse the crudity of this model. I didn’t have time to build it to scale or to paint it.”  
> **Marty**: “It’s good.”  
> **Doc**: “Oh, thank you. Thank you.”

Marty winds up the toy car and Doc readies himself with the jumper cables at the clock tower. Marty releases the vehicle. When the car crosses the wire Doc sends the electricity through the line igniting the toy car. 

Every moment in a movie is carefully considered, there can be no wasted scene. This scene doesn’t include any great special effects and it practically gives away the ending. So why did Robert Zemeckis do this? The scene is more important to the telling of the story than one might expect. Doc’s prototype helps the audience in at least four important ways.

## 1. Clarifies “the Plot”
Even in its simplicity, the prototype communicates a complex plan in a short amount of time. It provides a roadmap, making it easier to follow what is to come. In a few short minutes, an entire movie theatre of people, of various ages and backgrounds, are all on the same page. In the movies and in life, it doesn’t always seem like everyone is “watching the same movie”, so to speak. It’s so easy to get separated as the length of the work, complexity, and number of people increase. Dennis Boyle, Partner at IDEO said it well: 

> “If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a thousand meetings.”

## 2. Establish Skills and Team Dynamics
Detailing a plan allows the characters to demonstrate their skills and knowledge. It can highlight their strengths, expertise, and the dynamics within a team. In a story this can help to develop the characters and deepen the understanding of their roles and relationships. A prototype should always rely on the skills and expertise of the team who executes the plan. When individuals can see _the outcome_, instead of just a list of isolated tasks, the team can react to any twist or turn.

## 3. Encourages Audience Participation
When the audience sees the plan, they can mentally participate in the execution. They might anticipate potential problems or come up with their own solutions. The process becomes more interactive, memorable, and engaging. It means greater buy-in and transparency for stakeholders.

## 4. Establishes Stakes and Consequences
When the toy car bursts into flames we begin to see more fully what the stakes are. Sure, Marty could be stuck in 1955 but if the plan doesn’t go smoothly it could be _worse_ than that. When we see the prototype in action the consequences become real and more impactful. Prototypes allow us to experience the risks without actually taking them. 

## Why a story
In the movies, maps, models, or plans are often used to guide the characters (and the audience) along the rest of the journey. As in real life, this can happen with minimal time and production costs. The result is a way to provide structure, understand risk, establish team dynamics, and engage others. A prototype allows a group to rally around a path and become active participants in the journey. When the road under our feet becomes clear we can set our collective sights on the road ahead. When everyone becomes more informed and involved, we anticipate twists and turns—_and it’s more fun_.
