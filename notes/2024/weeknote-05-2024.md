- I have participated in the [Strata Easel Challenge](https://www.stradaeasel.com/pages/january-2024-strada-31-day-challenge-information) since the new year. The challenge is to draw or paint something *from life* for 31 days. Even before I began I knew it would be a challenge because most days the only free time I have is after dark. For the most part small still lifes were what I chose, but there were a few days where I was able to paint or draw from the window.. Each day was a new problem which meant a lot of starts and a lot more practice than usual.
