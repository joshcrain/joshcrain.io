description: Weekly notes for week 26/2024.

- This week (and last) I updated my [notes](/notes/) page to include more than just long-form notes. For a while now I have kept [weeknotes](/tags/weeknotes/) but the only way to access them was from the homepage. Also, I thought it might be interesting to display a list of recent notes from my [running log](/running/). Now all “notes” can be found on one page. 
- Speaking of running, I need to take a little time off. I can’t seem to shake whatever’s going on with my left calf. 
- 5 years this week.
