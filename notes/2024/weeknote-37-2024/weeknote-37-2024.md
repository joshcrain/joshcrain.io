In his book _Freehand Drawing Self-Taught_, Arthur Guptill recommends that the student identify and label three edges: sharp, softer, and softest in the early stages of a drawing. This helps the student identify edges early and be more intentional with their appearance. 

 As a general rule hard edges move forward while soft edges recede. Edges has been a difficult thing for me to keep in mind especially early in the process. As with most things, doing helps me remember far better than just reading. I rendered a copy of his example as a reminder of this lesson.
