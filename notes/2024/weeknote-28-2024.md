- I slightly updated the [Notes](/notes/) page to include the first few lines of the weeknote content instead of the weeknote title. The titles are repetitive and dull, the only thing different is the week number. Unlike other posts, the date is not representative of the whole week, just a marker of when the file was created so I deleted it.  
- Vertigo again. It makes me tired.
