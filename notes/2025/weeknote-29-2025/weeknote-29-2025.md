- I ran [a mile road race on Sunday](/running/2025/19720832404/). The official time was 5:25.883. I was disappointed. There was a decent hill so I'm not sure what I expected. I've been able to run consistently, 6 days a week for only the last 6 weeks. The consistency is just not there. I ran [7 miles on Monday](/running/2025/19728960568/) and felt great.
