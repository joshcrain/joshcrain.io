- Although I have had no updates in a while I have been busy. I have been spending more time offline, reading and drawing. I joined a discord art group where I’ve shared work in progress which allows me to get feedback without all the negatives of social media. 
- I started a book called *Art & Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking* by David Bayles and Ted Orland. I found it at a thrift store this week and have been reading it between daily tasks. As I do, it feels like I’ve had a conversation with the authors, or even, that the book is reading mind. This is a book that came at the right time. 
- I’ve had some other successes with books in the last month or so. Picked up cheaply, I’ve bought enough to keep me busy for a while. 
- Among those are books on writing. I’ve finished *On Writing Well* by William Zinsser and *Writing in General and The Short Story in Particular* by Rust Hills.
- I finished a book I started when I was in high school but never finished. In some way the book represented a season of things disrupted. Finished, it feels like a victory against all things left undone. Well worth the dollar I paid at the local library—*PRE: The Story of America’s Greatest Running Legend, Steve Prefontaine* by Tom Jordon. 
- No running until my back is 100%.
