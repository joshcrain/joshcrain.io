- I published [a post last week](/notes/2025/the-bobolink-link/). I had an experience, something that I may have connected and let slip past but I chose to remember it. I’m happy I responded by writing about it, bringing it alive with words and image. This is one of the most appealing things about writing and making in general. 
- I added another random panel to [The Galactic Guppy](https://galacticguppy.net/). It had been sitting around unfinished for a long time. Speaking of comics, I found a copy of *Understanding The Invisible Art of Comics* by Scott McCloud in a little free library. It’s a book I’ve had on my list to read for a long time. 
- I added a lot of code to `.eleventy.js` to create an open graph social image for each post. I have avoided this because I don’t create content on this website to share on social media. It seemed like a waste of time, but I did it anyway.
