- In the last few weeks I gathered together a portfolio. The last time I did so was right after college, and it was all student work, so there was a lot to consider. It was a useful exercise and forced me to think more about the most influential projects and moments of my career. It was difficult, not only because so much time had passed but it's hard for me to look back. Once that window of time (and it's short) has passed I tend to look forward to new work. The transient nature of the internet is a strange thing to contemplate. A huge portion of my work over the years no longer exists. It lives for while, it's modified, then replaced. It certainly has made me wonder what my work has built. It's a strange feeling. I guess that's one reason for this website and and argument for better contemporary documentation.
