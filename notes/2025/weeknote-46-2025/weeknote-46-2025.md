I saw the northern lights for the first time this week. When I heard others could see them in town I went straight to the window. From there, the sky looked only a little greener at the horizon. A few minutes later, a red smudge appeared a bit higher. I walked out to the yard, squinting past the street light, and took this photo. The photo is far brighter and more distinct than what I experienced. I wonder how much my iPhone camera is designed to _enhance_ northern lights. It makes a nice picture but it feels like a cheat. I wish I had been out in the country to see it first-hand. Some of the photos from social media are unreal. Later, I drove to the school up the hill, thinking I‘d get a better vantage and a darker sky, but by then it had faded.
