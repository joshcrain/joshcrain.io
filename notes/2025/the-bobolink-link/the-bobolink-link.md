The truck bumbled over the horse path toward the road. It was a good afternoon of fishing. The rain from the morning held and touches of blue sky slowly appeared in the west. A white egret stalked the pond’s northern shallows while we sat in the small fishing boat. As we reeled fish to the surface we guessed the catch. Crappie flashed white, bass a warmer gold.

From the tottering trunk I watched a white and black bird light on a tall stalk of prairie grass and ride its momentum, back and forth like a swing. Its size and shape, that of a red-winged blackbird, but the coloration—black and white… or was it white and black? It looked like something else entirely.

A bird in motion is difficult to take in, but this one seemed even less tangible, more irregular. I made an intentional effort to put words to what I saw, some memorable attribute to help me later. Its back, striped like a skunk, brought it closer to something known. Naming removes the mystery. It brings order to chaos. Later, as I thumbed through a bird guide I found the black bird, striped and spackled with white. _A male bobolink_.

The next morning in bed my mind rolled the name over again. “Bobolink. Bobolink,” I said to myself. Why is that familiar? And then I remembered. [Bobolink Books](http://www.bobolinkbooks.com/BALLAST/books.html) was founded by my college professor, [Roy Behrens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Behrens), who is well known for his writings on camouflage. The bobolink is a prairie bird whose high-contrast coloration serves a purpose—dazzle camouflage. In the First and Second World Wars artists and designers used these concepts to create similar camouflage. Unlike other types of camouflage, which hide, dazzle obscured the size, range, and heading of military equipment. It is an effective way to confuse an enemy reliant on visual information. 

It is no wonder I found it difficult to describe—even to myself. That’s by design.
