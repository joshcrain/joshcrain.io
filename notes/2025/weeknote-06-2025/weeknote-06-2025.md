- I read *The Scrolls From the Dead Sea* by Edmund Wilson. The story of how the scrolls were found is just as amazing as the implications to biblical history.
- I needed to create a polygon so I started to experiment with methods I've used before. I thought there must be a better way. I learned a lot about [modern CSS shapes](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/modern-guide-making-css-shapes/#triangles) this week.  [CSS clip path generator](https://unused-css.com/tools/clip-path-generator) is quite helpful to better understand what's happening with the coordinates.
