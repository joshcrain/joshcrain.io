This week I stumbled upon [a post by Nic Chan](https://www.nicchan.me/blog/building-my-new-website-part-6-font-fallbacks/#artwork), a fellow _artist_ and web developer. 
As she makes updates to her site, she’s put to words some of the decisions and internal debates along the way. One of the debates—whether to include art—is something I struggled with too.

There is no shortage of oversharing on the Internet today, so why would I, why would anyone have second thoughts about sharing pictures they’ve made? Imposter syndrome is real.

Her debate and self-doubt ended, she says, when she stumbled upon my site. Wow! 

[Her paintings](https://www.nicchan.me/art/) are quite wonderful.
