I don’t love this end-of-the-year write-up. I hate looking back, it sucks my energy. I get more excited looking forward to something new. Even so, in years past *I have* found it useful to look back to other years in review, so for now, I continue.
## Running
This summer, I started waking up early with the sunrise. I didn’t want to lie in bed for an hour or more, and I didn’t want to do anything that would wake the family. So I started running. Morning runs have always been difficult for me, even though there is no better time to run than before the heat of the day. It became a time I looked forward to, for the exercise and time outdoors. I encountered more wildlife than I would have expected over the next several months.

I saw foxes almost daily for a few weeks this fall. One morning, I stood in the driveway after a run. I heard a noise to my right. I turned and saw a large fox run from between the houses and then cut through the neighbor’s yard, not more than 15 yards from me. On another day, I saw three near the school, running and playing in the parking lot. Then, because I had a headlamp, I saw their glowing eyes spying at me from the trees after they hid. On another morning, I saw the dark silhouette of one hunting. Its head, body, and tail were low, stiff, and perpendicular to the ground as it crept across the trail in the shadows. When it heard me it turned to my direction, saw me, then fled in the direction it had come. 

There were even some firsts. I had never seen a mink before this year. I saw two, each on a different day. Like the foxes, I saw both around the same time. Last August, I was [attacked by an owl](http://localhost:8081/notes/2025/the-ghost-on-the-trail/)—not [once](http://localhost:8081/running/2025/20054884183/), but [twice](http://localhost:8081/running/2025/20096431887/).
### Running Stats
- I averaged 16.5 miles per week for the year (29 miles/week between June and October). 
- I ran 123.7 miles in September. 
- My best workout was in [September](/running/2025/20340840484/). Five sets of 400m + 800m with 225-meter jog between. 1:20, 2:49. 1:18, 2:46. 1:18, 2:46. 1:18, 2:45. 1:20, 2:45.
- I upgraded my running watch from a Garmin Forerunner 45 to a 265S. I’ve used the 45 since 2020. 
### Records for 2025
- 1 mile: 5:25.883 on [7/13/2025](/running/2025/19720832404/) in the Espresso Mile. I wasn’t so pleased with the time but considering I had started daily running in May, it was a good start.
- Longest run: 9.4 miles on [10/5/2025](/running/2025/20599061330/).
## Site 
I did not have a lot of time this year to invest in this website, but I did make a few changes. In October, I [optimized my self-portrait](http://localhost:8081/notes/2025/weeknote-43-2025/) on the homepage. The size reduction improved the carbon rating of this site from 0.04 g of CO2 to [0.02 g of CO2](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/joshcrain-io/). This is the first year I started tracking that metric.

The internet has become such a depressing place. AI has made such an impact on what content is produced and shared. There is so much slop. So much noise. So when I encountered these websites, created by my some talented people, they were places worth remembering. Personal websites, like these, stand for something important in a sea of social posts and manufactured AI realities. I like to see what people are making and how they get there.

## New Things
In November, I saw the [Northern lights](http://localhost:8081/notes/2025/weeknote-46-2025/) for the first time. It wasn’t as clear in town, but still exciting. Earlier that day, on a whim, we toured a house for sale in our neighborhood. It really lit something up inside my brain. Even through all the problems (it really is in a sorry state), I could see so many possibilities and what it could be. This visit led us to put an offer on the house, and that offer *was accepted*.

On to 2026!
