description: Favicons and a self-portrait illustration.
date: 2022-03-10

- I added a self-portrait illustration to the homepage. It's something that I wanted to do for some time. I created the illustration in Adobe Fresco using vector brushes. I manually edited the SVG in a text editor to apply custom properties to allow me to update the colors based on a users preference for light or dark mode.
- I decided to finally add more than just a small (inline SVG) favicon to this site. The touch icons use the illustration I created earlier in the week. I followed _some_ of what [How to Favicon in 2022](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) suggests for a slim implementation.
