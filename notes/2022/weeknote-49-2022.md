description: Still no progress on the office, still no sign of my journal.

- The office is still in progress. Looks like it’s been in progress about 7 weeks now. I got a lot done the first week. I‘ve had to wait several weeks to get someone lined up for sheetrock and I‘m still waiting. And I think that‘s OK, since I still have some finishing to do on the framing. 
- I‘ve given up. A few weeks ago lost a journal and I still can‘t find it. There are a lot of important events I documented. I‘m sad to have lost it. 
- Took the dog to the vet, she‘s still having troubles healing from the abscess on her neck. 
- Published [*The Lonely Place*](/notes/2022/the-lonely-place/) after spending some time in the country.
