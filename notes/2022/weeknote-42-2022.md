- The weeks go by quickly. 
- On Thursday I began demolition in my office space to increase the size of the door to the adjoining crawlspace.  This is the office space Iâ€™ve used in the basement for around the last year. On Friday I began framing the walls. There are various small items to complete before I can move to electricity and sheetrock.
