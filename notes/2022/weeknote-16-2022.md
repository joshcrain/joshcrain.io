- I’m really enamored with [How Many Plants](https://howmanyplants.com/). It is such a wonderfully fun and helpful website. The illustrations by [Evie May Adams](https://www.eviemayadams.com/) are, I think, why I feel this way. So good.  
- I’ve been thinking a lot about backlogs. Backlogs of bugs and features are very helpful. Backlogs can easily grow to be too large to be manageable or up-to-date. 
	- Do backlogs make us lose sight of priorities and goals?
	- Are inventories a way to gate-keep product or UX priorities?
	- Are backlogs a way to put one’s knowledge and expertise on display? Whose pile is bigger?
- A discussion on the topic and my questions about what is valued, prompted the analogy: 

> “The backlog is a burning building. What are the things you really need to get out?”
