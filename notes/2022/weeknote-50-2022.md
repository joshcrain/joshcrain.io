- A week after I had given up on finding my journal—it's been found!
- Vertigo has come back. Planning to take some time off from running. A few days at least. This is a bit of a disappointment, I hope I still hit my goal for the quarter.
- Office walls have been textured. I hope to paint this weekend.
