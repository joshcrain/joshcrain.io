- I struggled for a few days with a very strange layout issue in Safari. I never could pin down the exact cause other than a hover with an outline or drop shadow on a button would break a grid layout elsewhere on the page. Safari TP came out on Tuesday and itâ€™s no longer an issue. I'm done worrying about it. 
- I found the article [Accessible Modal Dialog With CSS3 Animations](https://www.cssscript.com/accessible-modal-dialog-animations/) and [example](https://www.cssscript.com/demo/accessible-modal-dialog-animations/) to be helpful to get a native dialog up and running.
