- Spent some time finalizing Design Principles and noticed natural connections to items in the (gasp) Agile Manifesto. My wanderings led me to Jeremy Keith’s [Agile design principles](https://adactio.com/journal/19066) and a link he referenced for Miriam Posner’s piece [Agile and the Long Crisis of Software](https://logicmag.io/clouds/agile-and-the-long-crisis-of-software/) which is really good. 
- Designing Your Life: “If it’s not actionable it’s not a problem.”
