- Vertigo. No running this week.
- I set out last week to rethink my options with the Art section of my site. I would like to utilize _Collections_ and create pages from JSON data. I ran into some struggles and while investigating a solution in the Eleventy documentation found a way to [_page_ to  previous and next posts](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/collection-items/). 
- Linking to other posts is something I have wanted to do but it couldn’t think of an easy way. _This is easy_. So that is done—and I like the way it turned out. 
- Over the last week I’ve made some design updates including custom properties for _all the things_, other general refactors of CSS, background color change for light mode, updated the font-family to use system [ui-serif and ui-monospaced fonts](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-fonts-4/#ui-serif-def) ([Working Draft, Safari only](https://caniuse.com/extended-system-fonts)).
- [Building Consistent UIs with Open Props w/ Adam Argyle!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O53MwmolKP4) was really helpful, thoughtful, and gives me some ideas. 
- 10-mile bike ride on Friday (3/4/2022) over lunch. Legs felt very tired by the end. Haven't run in over a week and a half (2/21/2022). Anxious to get rolling again. I think I’m getting past the vertigo, hopefully.
