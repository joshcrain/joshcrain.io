Back in 2006, I stumbled upon a website called [Life In Vector](http://lifeinvector.com). At the time I was still learning what Illustrator could do, the work was eye-opening. I followed the [gradient mesh tutorial](http://lifeinvector.com/downloads/) for a red pepper (I cannot believe this is still online) and learned a lot about working more effectively with layers and gradients.

Everything rendered this way seemed to have a plastic quality so I began to look for something that *was* plastic. At the time I played the keytar in a band called Dr. Mike (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/">Amazon</a>,  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026">iTunes</a>). The SHS-10 was perfect. I spent the next several weeks over lunch breaks working on it. I still see this image in searches for the Yamaha SHS-10, even though itâ€™s been at least ten years since I last published it online.
