* Made significant progress on an updated patterns library I started [a few weeks back](/notes/2020/weeknote-9-2020/). Started to think a bit more about how I can use _web components_ to take the next step towards a ’living’ project.
* An additional 720 cases confirmed in Iowa on Friday. The numbers continue to increase each day. 
* There is more talk of reopening the state though I can’t see what data backs this up.
* Signed up for an [axe Pro](https://www.deque.com/) (beta) account which helped identify some improvements with [the contact form](https://joshcrain.io/say-hello/) and prompted me to make a few [SVGs more accessible](https://css-tricks.com/accessible-svgs/) among other things. 
* Tuesday’s run was too quick again. 6:45, 6:49, 6:45 for 3 miles. 
* Warmer and bright on Sunday. I spent some time wandering around the backyard dreaming about outdoor projects. Even after the snow the grass has been as healthy as I can remember, so I was surprised to see some spots leading around the yard. The first ones I noticed led to the side gate, circled curiously, and returned in the direction they came. I followed the trail and observed the alternating nature of the spots like a right and left foot. With certainty the spots were created by the dog crunching through the frozen grass.
