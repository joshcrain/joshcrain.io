I’ve decided to do something different and more intentional. Each week I spend time learning new things, but rarely keep any record of it. Maybe I like a tweet or pen, but it’s nowhere I can easily reference later. So here we are, this is why I created this blog in the first place. 

* I found a handy CSS property called [scroll-margin-top](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-top) perfect for websites with fixed headers and jump links. 
* I’ve been hearing some chatter about a [potential CSS4 spec](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/4770). Are we all just tired of waiting for new stuff?
* I spun up an instance of [Fractal](https://fractal.build/) last week so I can work on a component framework strategy. 
* It’s on my list to [get acquainted with Svelte](https://css-tricks.com/getting-acquainted-with-svelte-the-new-framework-on-the-block/) and then [give it a try](https://svelte.dev/).

* Reorganized the [notes](/notes/) section of this site to categorize posts by year and created a place for drafts.
