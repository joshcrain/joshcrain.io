Design principles are the guideposts I use to create user-centric interfaces that are scalable yet coherent.

1. **Begin with the user:** Research, analyze data, ask questions, talk to users, and test solutions. With a focus on the user, design becomes an opportunity to influence outcomes instead of a series of logistical or creative challenges. 
2. **Coherency over consistency:**
Do not assume uniformity will always produce an excellent result. Designs should be consistent and standard but not at the sacrifice of coherency. Coherency acknowledges the importance context plays for the user and leaves room to innovate when itâ€™s important.
3. **Embrace limitations:** Do less and send less. Rely on existing conventions, the browser, and web standards to do the heavy lifting. Limitations put a focus on what is essential and what adds the most value for users.
