## Design / Development
This website is made by hand with Visual Studio Code on a Mac. It is designed in the browser. The site supports light and dark mode based on the user’s system or website preference. 

This website is built with Eleventy (11ty) using HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, CSS, and Javascript. Git is used for version control. Github is used to host [the repository](https://github.com/joshcrain/joshcrain.io). Netlify hosts the website. The mark-up is written to be compliant with web standards. 

## Illustration
The [SVG self portrait](/notes/2022/svg-self-portrait/) illustrated for this site was drawn with an Apple Pencil on an iPad using vector brushes in Adobe Fresco. VSCode was used to improve best practices and accessibility. SVGO was used to optimize the code and reduce file size.

## Accessibility
Special effort has been made to give the text and background colors a high contrast for those with limited sight. Text has a 4.5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA or better, as specified by [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). If you find an issue accessing any part of this site please [file an issue](https://github.com/joshcrain/joshcrain.io/issues). 

## Page Speed & Energy
Page speed and economy of code have two benefits. Pages are retrieved fast and energy usage is low. Code and assets are compressed, unnecessary scripts (tracking or otherwise) are avoided. This site receives a perfect score (400) on [PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-joshcrain-io). As of May 1, 2025 this site is [cleaner than 96% of web pages](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/joshcrain-io/), producing 0.04 g of CO2 every time someone visits the homepage.
