This website was created by hand with Visual Studio Code on a Mac. It is written in HTML, Markdown, Nunjucks, CSS, and Javascript. The mark-up is written to be compliant with web standards. The layout uses CSS Grid for a custom layout. 
 
 Eleventy is used for static page generation. Git is used for version control. Github is used to store the repository. Netlify hosts the website.

 The serif typeface is UI Serif, defined by the operating system. Otherwise it is Palatino. Special effort has been made to give the text and background colors a high contrast for those with limited sight. Text has a 4.5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA or better, as specified by <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" rel="noopener">WCAG 2.0</a>.
