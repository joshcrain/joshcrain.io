## Philosophy
As I built this site I wondered about what it would be, who it might help, and why it would exist. The Internet has become such a loud and awful place (and it only continues to get worse). For some reason, I thought of [a place I know](/notes/2022/the-lonely-place/), a lonely, quiet place in the country. I wondered, what if this site lives here? This was the picture I gave myself when thinking of this websiteâ€™s place on the Internet. A lonely place, disconnected but part of the whole.

## Design / Development
This website is made by hand with Visual Studio Code on a Mac. It is designed in the browser. Special effort has been made to give the text and background colors a high contrast for those with limited sight. Text has a 4.5:1 contrast ratio at Level AA or better, as specified by [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/). The site supports light and dark mode based on system or user preference. 

This website is built with Eleventy (11ty) using HTML, Nunjucks, CSS, and Javascript. Git is used for version control. Github is used to host [the repository](https://github.com/joshcrain/joshcrain.io). Netlify hosts the website. The mark-up is written to be compliant with web standards. 

This website does not track your activity.

## Illustration
The [SVG self portrait](/notes/2022/svg-self-portrait/) illustrated for this site was drawn with an Apple Pencil on an iPad using vector brushes in Adobe Fresco. VSCode was used to improve best practices and accessibility. SVGO was used to optimize and reduce file size.
