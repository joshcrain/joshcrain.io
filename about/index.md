Hi, I’m *Josh Crain*—a designer and front-end developer working in product design. I have worked on a wide range of design and technical problems over the last 20 years. Design problems and approaches vary but my [design principles](/about/design-principles/) guide me to create user-centric interfaces that are scalable yet coherent. My work allows me to make an impact through user advocacy, web standards, research, and code.

[Running](/running/) and [art](/art/) break me out of my daily routine—*and who doesn't need that?* Both challenge me to make something with the day. Both can leave me feeling spent. Both take a little and give a lot. 

## Other interesting things
- I occasionally make [illustrations](/tags/illustration/), which has included work for an Olympic gold medalist. When I have nothing productive to do I draw a webcomic called [The Galactic Guppy](https://galacticguppy.net/), _The Ultimate Fish Out Of Water Story_. 
- _Many summers ago_ I played the [keytar](/notes/2020/yamaha-shs-10/) in _Dr. Mike_. You should buy the album, _A Mighty Love_, on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/) or [iTunes](https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026).
- I researched and created a website of [Crain family ancestry](/ancestry/) for my dad. You are welcome to [contact me](/say-hello/) with any interest.
