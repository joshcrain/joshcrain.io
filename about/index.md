## Professional
I have been building things on the web professionally for almost 20 years. I began my career at an agency where I designed, presented, and delivered code. I learned how to scale my work (and the work of others) by formalizing best practices and patterns that unified our design approach. Around this same time, I also had opportunities to work on products. Everything I did seemed to have connection to a design system. Eventually, I was able to move to a dedicated role at one of these products. This was exciting because it provided the opportunity to work _directly with users_ and focus even more on design systems. 

## This site
Iâ€™ve made a lot of websites, but for years I struggled with what to do with a personal site. When I shifted my focus to what I wanted to learn it became easier to get started. This site is as much a collection of tinkerings as it is words about me. 

## Elsewheres
- [The Galactic Guppy](https://galacticguppy.net/), _The Ultimate Fish Out Of Water Story_ is a webcomic. 
- I created a website of [Crain family ancestry](/ancestry/). You are most welcome to [contact me](/say-hello/) with any interest. 

## Other interests
- Many summers ago I played the [keytar](/notes/2020/yamaha-shs-10/) in _Dr. Mike_, one the the greatest bands of all time. You should buy our album, _A Mighty Love_, on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Love-Dr-Mike/dp/B000FSMMNK/) or [iTunes](https://music.apple.com/us/album/a-mighty-love/97175026). You'll thank me.
- I like to run. I created a way to track my [running activity](/running/) using data from my watch.
