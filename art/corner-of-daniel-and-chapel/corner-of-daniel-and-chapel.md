The corner of Chapel Street and Daniel Street in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The drawing is based on a photo by Samuel Chamberlain from a lesson in Ernest W. Watsonâ€˜s book, _Course in Pencil Sketching_.

I looked for the church on [Street View](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VzLGyq4fE2UHyJqi8?g_st=ic) to figure out where the photo was taken in Portsmouth. Judging by the cars the photo was taken in the 1950s. A lot has changed. No little fence and no big tree in the lawn.
