At the end of 2023, I felt a bit disappointed about how little I had done. It wasn't until I began looking for the work, that I could note in my [2023 year-in-review](/notes/2023/2023-in-review/), that I realized how little I had drawn or painted. I must have spent a lot of time *thinking* about what I'd like to do, and perhaps, that deceived me into believing more work had been done.

When I saw [Strata Easel advertise a January challenge](https://www.stradaeasel.com/pages/january-2024-strada-31-day-challenge-information) I thought it could be an opportunity, one where I'd be held accountable (and would have a chance to win a Strada Easel). It kept me moving.  

One of the constraints of the challenge was to work from life. This influenced what I could work on because the only consistent time I have is after everyone else has gone to bed. For this reason, I stuck to small objects that could be drawn or painted in an hour or two. Although I could have spent multiple nights on one picture I opted for *more starts*. I thought this would be the best way to practice and would allow me to turn the page on the last, especially if it wasn't working out.

I didn't win anything but I enjoyed the time to focus. The month went fast.
