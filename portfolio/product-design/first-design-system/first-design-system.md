**Role:** UX Designer & Front-End Developer  
**Company:** Spinutech  
**Years Active:** 2005 – 2016

## Summary

While working as a UX designer and front-end developer at Spinutech, I created an internal front-end pattern library that helped align designers and developers across dozens of custom client websites. Long before “design systems” were common practice, this effort standardized our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components across a wide range of responsive marketing sites, ecommerce platforms, and intranets — improving accessibility, development speed, and cross-team clarity.

---

## The Problem

Spinutech’s design and development teams were regularly launching custom websites across a range of industries — from banking to retail to B2B. Projects moved quickly, and transitions from static design comps to browser-ready code were inconsistent and sometimes brittle.

Each team had its own way of interpreting comps, which led to:

- Friction during handoff between design and development
- Inconsistent markup and accessibility practices
- Difficulty maintaining or scaling shared components
- Tight deadlines that left little room for refinement

At the same time, I wanted to reduce implementation overhead so I could spend more time solving design problems — not rebuilding the same markup again and again.

---

## My Solution: A Shared Pattern Library

To address these challenges, I created and maintained a **standalone front-end pattern library**:

- A centralized website of reusable HTML/CSS/JS snippets
- Responsive, accessible patterns for common UI needs
- Support for metadata standards (e.g., Open Graph protocol)
- Contributions from designers and developers
- Documentation to guide consistent use and integration
- Logo and Identity (just for fun)

It became our shared starting point for design and development, significantly reducing time-to-browser while preserving fidelity to the original design intent.

---

## Key Outcomes

- **Faster implementation**: I could move from comps to a browser-ready build in 1–2 days
- **Better collaboration**: Reduced friction between design and development
- **Stronger standards**: Improved accessibility, semantic structure, and maintainability
- **Greater velocity**: Allowed more time for higher-level UX thinking and client collaboration
- **More consistent outcomes**: Regardless of designer or developer, starting points aligned

This effort helped shape the team’s internal workflow and elevated the quality of our shipped work across many high-profile clients.

## Notable Clients

- **Hy-Vee**: Worked closely with their internal design team, implementing front-end code that honored their visual language while improving structure and responsiveness
- **Electrolux, Firestone Ag, Whole Foods, Des Moines Airport**: Led full design and front-end efforts, often presenting directly to stakeholders, gathering feedback, and iterating toward launch

## What I Learned

This experience taught me how to:

- Build scalable solutions under real-world time and resource constraints
- Communicate effectively across disciplines and with clients
- Advocate for code quality, accessibility, and design fidelity
- Work with and support external design teams while offering UX leadership

It laid the foundation for how I think about systems, design operations, and collaboration today.
