**Role:** Designer & Front-End Developer
**Tools:** Fireworks, Dreamweaver, HTML, CSS, JS/jQuery
**Duration:** Full project lifecycle

## Project Overview

Country Clipper, a manufacturer of zero-turn mowers, needed a refreshed marketing website to support lead generation and empower their internal team to update content. The new site would serve as a modern sales tool—featuring customer testimonials, improved visual storytelling, and strategically placed calls to action.

The goal was to drive user engagement and inquiries while providing a CMS-ready front-end foundation that developers could integrate into their custom system.

## My Role & Approach

I was involved from day one, joining the initial client meetings to understand their brand, business goals, and internal capabilities. My responsibilities spanned both design and front-end development, and I worked closely with:

* The client’s marketing team to define success metrics
* Our internal design team to refine the UX/UI approach
* Developers to ensure a seamless handoff and technical feasibility
* Project managers to scope and pace the work within budget

---

## Design Process

To inform the design, I reviewed websites in the agriculture and equipment manufacturing space—analyzing content strategies and design conventions across the industry. I also evaluated competitor positioning to better communicate Country Clipper’s differentiators.

### Prototyping & Iteration

Initial mocks were created in Fireworks, then stitched together into clickable prototypes using Dreamweaver. These early builds facilitated conversations with stakeholders and made feedback loops quick and visual. Once approved, I transitioned the designs directly into responsive, production-ready HTML and CSS.

---

## Implementation & Hand-off

The front-end was built using semantic, accessible HTML and custom CSS—structured atop the **Common Patterns** design system I had created for internal reuse. This gave the build a solid foundation in accessibility and performance, with a customized layer for brand fit and styling.

I included some light jQuery and a modified carousel interaction to showcase product features. The final code was deployed to a staging server where developers could integrate it into the CMS. Non-obvious logic or interactions were documented and reviewed with the project managers for clarity.

## Challenges & Considerations

There were no major technical hurdles, but successful execution hinged on knowing the client’s strengths. I focused on delivering a site they could confidently maintain—adapting my design and code to match their internal capabilities. That alignment of design intent and practical sustainability was key.

---

## Outcomes & Reflections

The project was a success. The client not only embraced the final product but maintained it with pride for years after launch. This was a great example of mutual respect and collaborative ownership—where the client leaned into the design vision and carried it forward.

### What I Learned

This project underscored two things I carry into every engagement:

1. **Design for fit.** A good design isn’t just visually polished—it aligns with the client’s process, capacity, and mission.
2. **Always level up.** Each project is a chance to refine your technical skillset. This one deepened my understanding of accessible CSS architecture and scalable front-end patterns.
