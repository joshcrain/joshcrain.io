## Project Overview

The Des Moines Airport needed a redesigned website that served as a reliable information hub for travelers. The goal was to answer the most common traveler questions—such as flight status, parking availability, amenities, and wayfinding—while supporting ongoing content updates through a custom content management system.

We also aimed to integrate real-time data, including weather and flight information, in a way that was clear and useful for flyers navigating time-sensitive decisions.

## My Role & Collaboration

I led the design and front-end development efforts from the ground up, starting with on-site meetings to understand the airport's goals, audience, and pain points. Working closely with:

* The airport's stakeholders and project manager to surface content priorities
* Our internal design team to ideate layout and UX patterns
* Developers to assess feasibility of API integrations for flight and weather data

Together, we defined a phased approach that allowed us to move quickly while leaving room for iterative refinement.

## Design Process

Before design began, I audited peer and competitor airport websites to identify UX patterns that served different flyer needs—from frequent business travelers to families planning vacations. I also explored the capabilities and limitations of flight and weather APIs early to guide interface decisions.

### Prototyping Approach

Design began with low-fidelity mockups in Fireworks, followed by high-fidelity prototypes and in-browser builds. Feedback loops were fast and collaborative, with internal reviews and client input shaping refinements in structure and emphasis.

## Technical Implementation

Front-end development was completed using semantic HTML, modular CSS, and jQuery-powered JS interactions. I built atop our internal **Common Patterns** design system to ensure a foundation of accessibility and responsiveness, customizing layout and styles to fit the Des Moines Airport’s unique brand and content.

Key implementations included:

* Responsive layout with mobile-first prioritization
* Real-time integration zones for weather and flight info
* Custom iconography layered over API data for clearer UX
* Subtle CSS transitions for carousels, hover states, and image reveals

Upon completion, the front-end was deployed to a dev server for integration into a custom CMS by backend developers. Documentation was communicated through project managers and review sessions.

## Challenges & Adaptations

The most technically challenging part was working within the limitations of third-party APIs—understanding how much data could be customized and how it could be visually represented. Collaborating early with developers helped us align on what could be layered or re-styled to fit the design vision without breaking functionality.

We also refined navigation and featured content prioritization mid-project, as real content needs became clearer during stakeholder reviews.

## Outcomes & Takeaways

The site was considered a success by the client and users—and received an Addy Award in recognition of its design and execution. The project demonstrated the power of combining strong client collaboration with technical curiosity and visual polish.

### What I Learned

Explore the technical landscape early. The more you understand about the data and delivery mechanisms, the better you can design for flexibility, clarity, and accuracy. Don’t shy away from the backend considerations—they often shape the frontend’s real impact.
